                <h6>Fragmented Narrative Structure:</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    The fragmented narrative structure of "Wide Sargasso Sea" allows for the exploration of <strong>female subjectivity and agency</strong>. (As can be found in the novel <a href="md.html">Trust</a> comparing to Ms. Dalloway.) By presenting the story from multiple perspectives, including those of marginalized female characters like Antoinette and Christophine, the novel challenges the dominant, male-centered narratives of colonial literature. This fragmentation enables the voices of women to be heard and their experiences to be foregrounded, contributing to a feminist critique of patriarchal power structures.
                    The fragmented narrative structure also reflects the fractured nature of <strong>racial identity</strong> within colonial societies. Antoinette's mixed-race heritage and the complex racial dynamics of Caribbean society are mirrored in the disjointed and fragmented narrative, highlighting the ways in which colonialism disrupts and dislocates individual and cultural identities. The novel's use of multiple narrative voices allows for a more nuanced exploration of the intersecting experiences of race, gender, and class.
                    The fragmented narrative structure of "Wide Sargasso Sea" aligns with <strong>modernist experimentation</strong> with form and perspective. By disrupting linear notions of time and causality, the novel reflects the destabilized sense of self and reality often associated with modernist literature. The use of <underline>stream-of-consciousness techniques</underline> and shifts in narrative voice convey the complexity of human consciousness and challenge traditional narrative conventions, reflecting modernist concerns about the fluidity of identity and perception.
                </p>
                <h6>Exploration of Subjectivity:</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    The novel's exploration of subjective experience allows for a deeper understanding of the ways in which <strong>gender</strong> shapes individual consciousness and social interactions. By delving into the inner thoughts and emotions of its female characters, "Wide Sargasso Sea" highlights the ways in which women navigate and resist patriarchal norms and expectations.
                    The subjective experiences of characters of color, such as Antoinette and Christophine, provide insight into the ways in which <strong>racial identity</strong> shapes individual perceptions of self and others. By foregrounding these perspectives, the novel challenges stereotypes and misconceptions about race and ethnicity, offering a more nuanced portrayal of the complexities of racial identity.
                    The exploration of subjective experience in "Wide Sargasso Sea" reflects <strong>modernist concerns</strong> about the instability of reality and the fragmentation of identity. The use of stream-of-consciousness techniques and shifts in narrative perspective convey the fluidity of human consciousness and the multiplicity of subjective truths, challenging readers to question their assumptions about identity, truth, and perception.

                        Jane Eyre" follows a linear narrative structure, recounting the life story of its protagonist, Jane Eyre, in a chronological manner. The narrative is primarily focused on Jane's experiences, thoughts, and emotions, providing a coherent and cohesive account of her life.
                        It offers a feminist critique of <strong>Victorian society</strong>, focusing on Jane's quest for autonomy, independence, and self-determination. Jane challenges patriarchal norms and expectations, asserting her agency and refusing to conform to societal expectations of women. The novel foregrounds Jane's experiences and perspective, providing insight into the ways in which gender shapes individual consciousness and social interactions.
                        While "Jane Eyre" touches on themes of race and colonialism through Mr. Rochester's background in Jamaica, the novel primarily focuses on issues of gender, class, and morality within the English context. Characters of color are largely peripheral to the narrative, and their experiences are not foregrounded in the same way as in "Wide Sargasso Sea."

                        "Wide Sargasso Sea" and "Jane Eyre" both engage with themes of feminism, race, and social justice, yet they do so through divergent narrative structures and contextual lenses. 
                        <br>While "Jane Eyre" follows a linear narrative arc within the Victorian context, primarily focusing on the journey of its white, English protagonist, Jane Eyre, 
                        "Wide Sargasso Sea" disrupts traditional storytelling conventions with its fragmented narrative structure and exploration of subjective experience. 
                        <br>Through the lens of modernism, "Wide Sargasso Sea" critiques patriarchal power structures and colonial oppression within the Caribbean context, foregrounding the experiences of marginalized characters like Antoinette Cosway and challenging traditional narratives of femininity, race, and identity. In contrast, "Jane Eyre" primarily critiques societal norms and injustices within Victorian England, touching on themes of gender inequality, class disparity, and moral redemption.
