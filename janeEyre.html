                <h6>English Romanticism</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    English Romanticism often celebrates <strong>nature</strong> as a source of inspiration and solace. In "Jane Eyre," nature plays a significant role in the emotional and moral development of the characters. Jane often finds solace and connection with nature, especially during moments of turmoil or emotional conflict. (chapter 1 - 6)
                    <br>Additionally, Romantic literature often emphasizes the individual's emotions, experiences, and intuition. Jane Eyre embodies this <strong>individualism</strong>, as she asserts her independence and refuses to conform to societal expectations, shown in her confrontation with her foster family and Mr.Rochester.     
                    <br>Also, Romanticism tends to prioritize <strong>emotion over reason</strong>, and this is evident in Jane's passionate nature and her willingness to follow her heart, even when it conflicts with societal norms or her own rational judgment.
                </p>
                <h6>Christian Morality</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    Pre-modernism is also marked by the present of christian morality. <strong>Christian themes of redemption and forgiveness</strong> are central to "Jane Eyre." Characters like Mr. Rochester and St. John Rivers undergo moral transformation through repentance and forgiveness, reflecting Christian ideals of grace and salvation.
                    <br>What's more, Jane's strong <strong>moral conscience</strong> guides her actions throughout the novel, reflecting Christian ethics of compassion, honesty, and integrity. Her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of temptation or adversity, reflects a Christian moral worldview.
                    <br>Additionally, the novel explores themes of <strong>self-sacrificial love</strong>, echoing Christian teachings on love as the highest virtue. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester transcends social barriers and personal sacrifices, reflecting Christ-like qualities of unconditional love and forgiveness.

                        Antoinette's identity is <strong>fragmented</strong> due to her mixed heritage and the cultural dislocation she experiences in Jamaica. This fragmentation reflects modernist themes of alienation and existential uncertainty.
                        <br>This creates a <strong>subjective and unreliable narration.</strong> (As the same narrative shown in post-ww1 novels <a href="md.html">Ms. Dalloway</a> or <a href="trust.html">Trust</a>.) The novel presents multiple perspectives, including Antoinette's own subjective viewpoint, which challenges the reliability of the narrative. This experimentation with subjectivity aligns with modernist narrative techniques.
                        <br>The novel also discusses the <strong>exploration of Colonization</strong>. It explores the legacy of colonization and its impact on individuals and societies. Antoinette's story reflects the disintegration of cultural identities under colonial oppression, a theme that resonates with modernist concerns about cultural dislocation and imperialism.

                        Jane Eyre, a white protagonist, with Antoinette Cosway, a character of mixed race in "Wide Sargasso Sea", provides a rich exploration of <strong>racial identity, societal privilege, and colonialism</strong>.
                        Jane Eyre experiences privilege and marginalization within the context of Victorian England, primarily based on her gender and social class. While she faces obstacles and discrimination, her whiteness affords her certain advantages and opportunities denied to characters of color like Antoinette.
                        Both characters navigate intersecting systems of oppression based on race, gender, and social class. 
                        <br>However, Antoinette's experiences highlight the unique challenges faced by individuals of mixed race within colonial societies, where racial hierarchies are deeply entrenched.
                        While both novels engage with themes of colonialism, "Wide Sargasso Sea" offers a more direct exploration of the colonial experience in the Caribbean, foregrounding the voices and perspectives of characters marginalized by race and ethnicity.

                        <br>
                        Modernist literature often critiques traditional values and institutions, questioning the certainty of moral absolutes and the stability of social structures. While "Jane Eyre" upholds traditional moral values rooted in Christian ethics, "Wide Sargasso Sea" offers a more critical perspective on colonialism and the oppressive structures of power.
                        By foregrounding the voices and perspectives of characters marginalized by race and ethnicity, "Wide Sargasso Sea" challenges the dominant narratives of Victorian literature and exposes the underlying injustices of colonialism. This critique of traditional values aligns with modernist concerns about social injustice and the need for cultural and political change.
