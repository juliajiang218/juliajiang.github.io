                    Throughout Trust, money is wielded as a <strong>weapon</strong>. Bevel leverages as a successful male measured by modern societal standard uses his wealth to manipulate markets, controls narratives, and distances himself from others. The novel shows that immense wealth can be a corrupting force, distorting one's sense of reality and altering empathy.
                    <br>Additionally, it creates <strong>an illusion of meritocracy</strong>. Bevel's rise to power remains ambiguous because he controls the narratives. The novel suggests multiple times about the corrupting power of money. <u>"Capital may be clean, but Rask's hands are dirty with the plight of the nation..."</u> (My life) The fragmented narratives make it unclear if his wealth stemmed from genuine skill or exploitation. This ambiguity suggests that the wealthy elite might not always deserve their place at the top.

                <h6>fragmented narratives in modern life</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    With money and power, Andrew Bevel can <strong>shape the narrative</strong> and create <storng>a web of lies</storng>. Each section of the novel offers a conflicting perspective on Bevel, making it impossible to discern the absolute truth. This reveals the difficulty to trust any single narrator and exposes the subjectivity inherent in historical narratives.
                    <br>Bevel attempts to <strong>control his image through his unfinished autobiography</strong>, but it's ultimately challenged by the other narratives- Ida Partenza, and particularly his wife Mildred Bevel. This dynamic highlights the struggle for control over historical narratives, especially when wealth and power are involved.
                    As revealed by Ida Partnow, <u>"My job is about being right. Always. If I'm ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake."</u> This chilling quote from the financial journalist exposes the lengths to which some might go to control narratives.
                    <br>The fragmented structure forces the reader to become an active participant, piecing together the truth from various perspectives. This emphasizes the importance of considering multiple viewpoints when evaluating the actions of powerful figures <strong>in modern life, when single narrative is dicarded</strong>.

                <p class="text">
                    The novel brings readers the attention to <strong> Mildred(Bevel's wife)'s Silenced Voice </strong> Mildred's struggles to find her own agency within their marriage. Her perspective exposes the limitations placed on women of her class during this era. Her voice is often silenced or marginalized, reflecting the societal power structures that favor wealthy men.
                    <br>Additionally, it discuess the modern society puts <strong>the Working Class in the Shadows</strong>. The novel primarily focuses on the upper class, but the wealth they enjoy is built on the labor of the working class. Their stories remain untold, highlighting the vast gulf between the wealthy elite and those who enable their success.

                        The character <strong>Richard Dalloway</strong> is a symbol of societal expectations. Richard embodies the pressure to conform to a rigid definition of masculinity â€“ stoic, emotionless, and career-driven. This pursuit of the "ideal man" takes a toll on his emotional well-being and his relationships.
                        Another character <strong>Septimus Warren Smith</strong> is a victim of war trauma. He also suffers from toxic masculinity expectation. Septimus represents the fragility of the traditional masculine ideal. His shell-shocked state exposes the emotional vulnerability that society expects men to suppress.
                        The novel explores the impact of World War I on masculinity. The trauma and societal expectations to be unemotional leave men like Septimus struggling to cope, highlighting the destructive nature of toxic masculinity during wartime.
