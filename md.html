                <h6>non-normative female sexuality in modern society</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    Woolf's portrayal of female sexuality in "Mrs. Dalloway" is complex and nuanced. Through the characters of Clarissa Dalloway and Sally Seton, Woolf explores the awakening of sexual desire and the repression of lesbian identity in a society that condemns non-normative forms of sexuality. 
                    The novel suggests that <strong>women's sexuality is multifaceted</strong> and cannot be easily contained within societal norms or expectations. <strong>Woolf challenges conventional notions of femininity and sexuality</strong>, advocating for a more expansive and inclusive understanding of women's experiences.
                </p>
                <h6>agency and empowerment</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    Despite the limitations imposed by society, <strong>Woolf's female characters assert their agency and seek moments of empowerment in their lives</strong>. Clarissa Dalloway, though confined by her social position and gender expectations, finds moments of liberation in her inner thoughts and memories. 
                    Other characters, such as Septimus Warren Smith's wife, Lucrezia, and Sally Seton, also demonstrate resilience and agency in the face of adversity.
                     Woolf celebrates the strength and resilience of women, even in the face of societal oppression.
                </p>
                <h6>Liberation in modern society from repression by traditional societal values</h6>
                <p class="text">
                    In "Mrs. Dalloway," Woolf portrays the societal norms and expectations that repress women's desires, ambitions, and sexuality. 
                    Clarissa Dalloway, as a representative of the upper-middle-class woman of her time, deals with the restrictive conventions of her social status. 
                    Her internal monologue reveals the longing for freedom and self-expression that is often denied to women in patriarchal societies. 
                    Woolf explores the tension between conformity and rebellion, highlighting the ways in which women navigate the constraints of their social roles.

                    <h6>confined sexuality (as can be found in <a href="wss.html">Antoinette</a>) </h6>
                    <p class="text">
                        Mildred Bevel's Silenced Desires: Mildred's perspective reveals a woman expected to conform to societal expectations of femininity. There's little to no mention of her desires or sexuality, suggesting her life revolves around fulfilling her husband's needs.
                        <br>The Male Gaze: The novel focuses on the male characters and their perspectives. Mildred's thoughts and desires are often left unsaid, highlighting the societal tendency to view women primarily through the lens of male desire.
                        <br>Limited Choices: The narrative portrays a world where women have few options outside of marriage and domesticity. Mildred's role is primarily defined as wife and potential mother, with little room for personal aspirations or ambitions.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Traditional Female Values and Subversion: </h6>
                    <p class="text">
                        Suffering in Silence: Mildred embodies the traditional value of wifely stoicism. She endures a loveless marriage without complaint, sacrificing her own happiness for the sake of societal expectations.
                        <br>A Glimpse of Rebellion: Despite the constraints, Mildred exhibits moments of defiance. Her decision to write her memoir, even a fictionalized version, suggests a yearning for self-expression and a voice outside the confines of her marriage.
                        <br>The Stifling Nature of Duty: The novel suggests that traditional female values, centered on duty and self-sacrifice, can be disempowering. Mildred's unhappiness stems from her inability to pursue her own desires and fulfillment within the rigid social framework.

                    <h6>compare and contrast</h6>
                    <p class="text">
                        <strong>Societal Expectations:</strong><br>
                        Trust critiques the relentless pursuit of wealth and the ruthlessness associated with the American Dream in the industrial era. 
                        Mrs. Dalloway focuses on the rigid social expectations placed on women and the upper class in post-WWI England, which can also be connected back to <a href="janeEyre.html">Jane Eyre</a>, in comparsion to societal context pre-WWI.
                        <br>Both novels portray characters trapped by societal expectations. Andrew Bevel in Trust feels pressure to conform to the image of a self-made man, sacrificing his morals for success. Clarissa Dalloway in Mrs. Dalloway feels the weight of societal expectations for a proper upper-class wife.
                        <br>Both novels explore the stifling nature of societal expectations. Bevel's relentless pursuit of wealth isolates him, and Clarissa's focus on social appearances leaves her feeling unfulfilled.
                        <br><strong>Gender Roles:</strong><br>

                        Trust primarily critiques the limitations placed on women through Mildred Bevel's silenced desires and frustrations within her marriage. Mrs. Dalloway explores the societal pressures on both men and women, with Clarissa representing the constraints on women and Septimus Warren Smith representing the emotional repression expected of men.
                        Both novels depict women with limited agency. Mildred in Trust has little control over her life and desires. Clarissa in Mrs. Dalloway navigates societal expectations that restrict her choices and stifle her individuality.
                        Despite the limitations, both novels offer glimpses of female subversion. Mildred's act of writing her memoir, even fictionalized, suggests a yearning for self-expression. Clarissa's decision to prioritize her own happiness over societal expectations can be seen as a subtle act of rebellion.
                        <br><strong>Historical Context:</strong><br>
                        Trust (Early 20th Century America): The novel reflects the rise of industrial capitalism and the changing definitions of masculinity and femininity. The pressure to conform to the "American Dream" comes at a cost to individual fulfillment.
                        <br>Mrs. Dalloway (Post-WWI England): The novel explores the societal trauma and shifting social order following World War I. The rigid expectations placed on men and women are challenged by the devastation of the war and the changing landscape of society.
